<p>Looking for your classes? Ask your instructor to invite you to their class. Once you are in, your instructor will have to open the class for submissions before you will be able to set your status.</p>

<p>To use the website: </p>
<p>1. Create a class. Clicking "Lightbulb" in the left corner will bring up the Home page. From here you can view and create classes via their respective links.</p>
<p>2. Invite students. Clicking a course in the courses tab (top left) or from the view classes page will show a page allowing you to invite students. Just type in their account email, and that's it! Your students will now show up in their class.</p>
<p>3. Start a class. Clicking a course in the courses tab (top left) or from the view classes page will show a page which allows you to start the class. Starting the class allows students to submit their status. If a grid does not show up when start class is clicked, it is possible there are no invited students in the course.</p>

<legend>About Lightbulb</legend>
<p>Teachers want to help students, and we want to help teachers! Gone are the days of using homework scores from the previous class to estimate where the class stands. Our simple design of a color grid allows instructors to, in real time, see that lightbulb come on. </p>
